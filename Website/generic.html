							<p><ul> <p> Hello! I'm Ikoh Sylvanus Kujoh, a passionate cloud engineer with a focus on AWS (Amazon Web Services). I'm excited about leveraging the power of the cloud to build scalable and resilient solutions. Although I'm relatively new to the field, I've gained hands-on experience and developed a solid foundation in AWS services. </p>

								<p> My journey into cloud engineering began with a strong curiosity and eagerness to explore the latest advancements in technology. AWS caught my attention due to its vast array of services and its dominance in the cloud computing industry. I embarked on a learning journey, diving deep into AWS services, architectures, and best practices. </p>
								
								<p> Throughout my learning process, I've acquired essential skills in deploying and managing cloud infrastructure, utilizing serverless computing, implementing security measures, and optimizing performance. I have hands-on experience with core AWS services such as EC2, S3, Lambda, IAM, CloudFront, and more. </p>
								
								<p> I am a strong believer in continuous learning and staying up to date with the ever-evolving cloud landscape. I actively engage in online communities, attend webinars, and participate in industry events to expand my knowledge and network with fellow professionals. </p>
								
								<p> My goal is to contribute to the cloud engineering world by leveraging my skills and passion for AWS. I enjoy collaborating with teams, solving complex problems, and delivering solutions that meet business objectives. I am eager to take on new challenges, learn from experienced mentors, and make a positive impact in the cloud industry. </p>
								
								<p> In addition to my technical skills, I possess excellent communication and collaboration abilities, allowing me to effectively work in cross-functional teams and translate complex technical concepts into understandable terms for stakeholders. </p>
